1. Run the FastAPI Backend

Make sure you're in your backend directory, and that your virtual environment is activated:
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate

Then run the backend with:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

If all is set up correctly, you should see:
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

---
2. Run the React Frontend

Open a second terminal, then navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend
npm run dev

This should start the frontend on:
http://localhost:5173

---
Test Connection

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
Click the button on your test page.
You should see the backend response either in the UI or the browser console.
