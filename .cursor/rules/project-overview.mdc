# Soft Robot Simulator Project

## Project Overview

This is a modern desktop application for simulating soft robot kinematics using the Piecewise Constant Curvature (PCC) model, built with Tauri for optimal performance.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Tauri (desktop)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with comprehensive testing
- **Design**: macOS Tahoe 26 aesthetic with liquid glass styling
- **Testing**: 82+ test cases with full coverage

## Key Features

- 3D visualization of robot segments with real-time updates
- Real-time parameter adjustment with live preview
- Unit conversion (degrees/radians, mm/cm/m)
- Preset Management with user authentication
- Native desktop performance with Tauri

## Development Workflow

- Use `./dev.sh` for development
- Use `./build.sh` for production builds
- Use `./toolkit.sh` for development tools
- All styling with Tailwind CSS only (no direct CSS)
- Follow Tahoe liquid glass design system consistently

## Code Quality Standards

- Comprehensive testing required for all features
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Conventional commits with commitizen
- Full API documentation with FastAPI
