# BendBionics Project

## Project Overview

Modern web application for simulating soft robot kinematics using the Piecewise Constant Curvature (PCC) model. Deployed at **bendbionics.com** with React and FastAPI.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 (Vite)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
- **Deployment**: Ubuntu server + nginx + SSL (Let's Encrypt)
- **Design**: macOS Tahoe 26 aesthetic with liquid glass styling
- **Testing**: Focused on real user value and critical paths

## Key Features

- 3D visualization of robot segments with real-time updates (Three.js)
- Real-time parameter adjustment with live preview
- Unit conversion (degrees/radians, mm/cm/m)
- Preset Management with user authentication (JWT)
- Modular tendon calculation system (3-12 tendons)
- Web-optimized performance with modern browsers

## Development Workflow

- Use `./dev.sh` for development
- Use `./build.sh` for production builds
- Use `./deploy-workflow.sh` for deployment
- Use `./toolkit.sh` for development tools
- All styling with Tailwind CSS only (no direct CSS)
- Follow Tahoe liquid glass design system consistently

## Code Quality Standards

- **Essential Testing**: Test what actually breaks
- **TypeScript When Helpful**: Use types to prevent bugs, not for perfection
- **Basic Linting**: Catch obvious errors, not style perfection
- **Simple Commits**: Clear messages, no complex conventions
- **User-Focused Docs**: Document what users need, not everything
