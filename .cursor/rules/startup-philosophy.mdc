# Startup Development Philosophy

## Core Principles

Work like a true startup: **learn fast, focus relentlessly, and build what only we can build**.
Think **steering a car with a compass**: quick course corrections guided by vision, not endless roadmaps.

### Key Values

- **Validated Learning > Output**: Progress is measured by learning from users, not lines of code
- **Do the Hard Thing**: Aim for simplicity, but don’t confuse easy hacks with meaningful progress
- **Default to Action**: Small steps forward beat perfect plans standing still
- **Friction Kills**: Every barrier to iteration is a risk to survival

## Development Approach

- **Rapid Experimentation**: Ship small, test quickly, validate assumptions
- **First, Nail It**: Achieve product–user fit before optimizing for scale
- **Quick Wins, Long Vision**: Prioritize near-term value while keeping the long-term direction clear
- **Pivot or Persevere**: Let data decide whether to double down or change course

## Code Philosophy

- **YAGNI**: Don’t build for a future that may never come
- **KISS**: Prefer simple, maintainable solutions over clever ones
- **DRY, But Realistic**: Reuse where it clarifies; avoid abstractions that slow learning
- **Pragmatic Performance**: Optimize only when users feel the pain

## Decision Making

- **Bias for Action**: Ship, measure, learn — faster than competitors
- **Good Enough to Learn**: Perfection delays insight; release when value is testable
- **User-Centered Evidence**: Let real usage guide direction, not assumptions
- **Leverage Constraints**: Treat limitations as forcing functions for creativity

## Process Guidelines

- **Lightweight Documentation**: Capture only what helps the team move faster
- **Right-Sized Testing**: Automate what saves real pain; don’t gold-plate test suites
- **Continuous Delivery**: Ship often to derisk deployments and accelerate feedback
- **Talk to Users**: Every release should shorten the distance to real user feedback

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-Engineering**: Don’t build for hypothetical scale before validating demand
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Planning is useful only if it accelerates building
- **Perfect Code Fallacy**: Users care about value, not elegance
- **Process Worship**: Process exists to serve the product, not the other way around
- **False Optimizations**: Don’t polish what hasn’t proven to matter
