# Startup Development Philosophy

## Core Principles

Work startup-style: **quick and agile with lots of iterations like steering a car, not a rocket**.

### Key Values

- **Optimization by Reduction**: Remove complexity, not add it
- **Simple but Not Easy**: Achieve simplicity through thoughtful design, not shortcuts
- **Minimum Bureaucracy**: Eliminate processes that create friction
- **Friction = Failure**: Everything that slows down iteration leads to startup failure

## Development Approach

- **Rapid Iteration**: Make small, frequent changes rather than large, infrequent ones
- **Quick Wins**: Prioritize features that deliver immediate value
- **Fail Fast**: Identify problems early and pivot quickly
- **Reduce Friction**: Remove barriers to development and deployment

## Code Philosophy

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build for hypothetical future needs
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Choose simple solutions over complex ones
- **DRY with Purpose**: Don't repeat yourself, but don't over-abstract either
- **Premature Optimization**: Avoid it - optimize when you have real performance problems

## Decision Making

- **Bias for Action**: Make decisions quickly, iterate based on results
- **Good Enough**: Ship when it's good enough, not perfect
- **Measure and Learn**: Use data to guide decisions, not assumptions
- **Embrace Constraints**: Use limitations as creative catalysts

## Process Guidelines

- **Minimal Documentation**: Document only what's essential for team understanding
- **Automated Testing**: Focus on tests that prevent real bugs, not theoretical ones
- **Continuous Deployment**: Deploy frequently to reduce risk
- **User Feedback**: Get feedback early and often from real users

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Over-Engineering**: Building for scale you don't have yet
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Spending too much time planning instead of building
- **Perfect Code**: Writing code for other developers instead of users
- **Process Over Product**: Letting process become more important than outcomes
