# Development Workflow

## Project Scripts

Use the provided scripts for consistent development:

```bash
# Development
./dev.sh              # Start development servers
./setup.sh            # First-time setup
./build.sh            # Production build
./health-check.sh     # System health check
./toolkit.sh          # Development tools
```

## Code Quality Standards

- **Essential Linting Only**: Basic linting to catch obvious errors
- **TypeScript When Helpful**: Use types to prevent bugs, not for perfection
- **Quick Testing**: Test what breaks, not everything
- **Simple Commits**: Clear commit messages, no complex conventions

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/description
# Make changes
npm run commit  # Use commitizen for conventional commits
git push origin feature/description
```

## Development Tools

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic
- **Web**: Optimized for modern browsers
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit tests

## Code Organization

```bash
frontend/src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── features/       # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── api/           # API client and types
└── utils/         # Utility functions

backend/app/
├── api/           # API routes
├── models/        # Data models and business logic
├── utils/         # Utility functions
└── tests/         # Test files
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Optimize When Users Complain**: Don't optimize until there's a real problem
- **Measure First**: Use real user data to identify bottlenecks
- **Simple Solutions**: Choose simple optimizations over complex ones

## Documentation

- **Essential Docs Only**: Document what's actually needed
- **User-Focused**: Write for users, not developers
- **Living Docs**: Update docs when features change
