# Development Workflow

## Project Scripts

Use the provided scripts for consistent development:

```bash
# Development
./dev.sh                  # Start development servers
./setup.sh                # First-time setup
./toolkit.sh              # Development tools

# Production
./build.sh                # Create production build
./deploy-workflow.sh      # Deploy to bendbionics.com server

# Testing
./scripts/health-check.sh # System health check
bun run test:all          # Run all tests
```

## Code Quality Standards

- **Essential Linting Only**: Basic linting to catch obvious errors
- **TypeScript When Helpful**: Use types to prevent bugs, not for perfection
- **Quick Testing**: Test what breaks, not everything
- **Simple Commits**: Clear commit messages, no complex conventions

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/description
# Make changes
bun run commit  # Use commitizen for conventional commits
git push origin feature/description
```

## Development Tools

- **Frontend**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Package Manager**: Bun (frontend) - 10-30x faster than npm
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic + PostgreSQL
- **Python Package Manager**: uv (backend) - modern, fast
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js with @react-three/fiber
- **Web**: Optimized for modern browsers
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

```

## Performance Optimization

- **Optimize When Users Complain**: Don't optimize until there's a real problem
- **Measure First**: Use real user data to identify bottlenecks
- **Simple Solutions**: Choose simple optimizations over complex ones

## Documentation

- **Essential Docs Only**: Document what's actually needed
- **User-Focused**: Write for users, not developers
- **Living Docs**: Update docs when features change
