# Development Workflow

## Project Scripts

Use the provided scripts for consistent development:

```bash
# Development
./dev.sh              # Start development servers
./setup.sh            # First-time setup
./build.sh            # Production build
./health-check.sh     # System health check
./toolkit.sh          # Development tools
```

## Code Quality Standards

- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier for frontend, Ruff + Black for backend
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode, MyPy for Python
- **Testing**: Vitest for frontend, Pytest for backend
- **Commits**: Conventional commits with commitizen

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/description
# Make changes
npm run commit  # Use commitizen for conventional commits
git push origin feature/description
```

## Development Tools

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic
- **Desktop**: Tauri for native performance
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit tests

## Code Organization

```

├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── features/       # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── api/           # API client and types
└── utils/         # Utility functions

├── models/        # Data models and business logic
├── utils/         # Utility functions
└── tests/         # Test files
```

## Performance Optimization

- **Frontend**: Code splitting, lazy loading, memoization
- **Backend**: Async operations, caching, database optimization
- **Desktop**: Tauri's native performance benefits
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor with bundle analyzer

## Documentation

- **API Docs**: Auto-generated with FastAPI
- **Component Docs**: Storybook for UI components
- **Code Comments**: Clear, concise documentation
- **README**: Comprehensive setup and usage guides
